        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest in IT</h3>
        <p>
            I am primarily interested in software development and am also intrigued by AI and automation. The problem solving and creative 
            side of programming is what attracts me most to software development as well as other areas such as 3D modelling 
            and sound design that can be in the creation of software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automation and AI also interest me. These technologies will affect multiple fields such as defence, law enforcement 
            employment and logistics. I am curious to see how people and countries adapt and use technologies like facial recognition,
            self driving vehicles, lethal autonomous drones and the policies put in place to regulate their uses and effect on people and their livelihoods.

        <p>
            This job interests me because it looks like something I could be elligible for post graduation and would engage me
            in the creative problem solving department. This position would require that I learn to technologies, some of which I 
            am somewhat familliar with (SQL, Java) and others not so much (RESTful api). I would also need to step out of my comfort zone by 
            working in a team environment where I will have to actively contribute my own solutions. Some of these skills, teamwork and java, I am
            already working on by taking my current course.

        <p>
            Tests like these give myself insight into the ways and means by which I can improve in my personal and future professional life.
            This can include the types of resources I seek out to more effectively improve my learning during this course and how I can 
            better manage my relationships with current groupmates and future co-workers by being more extroverted.
        </p>
        <p>In a team I need to be more aware of the needs of my teammates. I also need to put more effort into expressing myself and my
            ideas in order to more effectively communicate with the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            When forming a team I may want to seek out people are able to effectively communicate with the whole team. I may also want
            the type of person who can help me relay my own ideas and solutions to the rest of the team.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Project Idea</h3>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            My project idea is a mobile application to teach rhythmic notation. There are already a few applications of this type on 
            both the Google Play and Apple App Store. However these applications only allow the user to interact by tapping the screen and 
            dont allow the user to use what they are usually going to play rhythms with.
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Music is a method of communication like a language and like the majority of languages it is important to able to read its 
            written form. Being able to read and perform rhythmic notation is essential to being able to send and recieve musical messages.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This application will allow to user to interact with it in two ways. The first will be tapping the screen like the previously 
            mentioned applications. The second is an audio input via the microphone on the users device. The microphone will be able to pick up 
            the sound of the users chosen instrument. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The app will feature 'playlists' of notated rhythms either created at random with limits set by the user or by the user themselves.
            Once the user selects one of these 'playlists' the rhythms will appear on screen and a metronome will count in the user to begin
            the exercise. The BPM (beats per minute) of the metronome can also be random in a range determined by the user or at random in a
            'playable' range - the BPM won't be set to 1 for example. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To more accurately detect the sound of the users instrument the user will select it from an in app menu. This selection will 
            determine what frequencies the application will accept as an input as all instruments have limits to the frequencies of sounds they can 
            produce. This can be seen in a number of instrument tuning applications.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly the user will recieve feedback in the form of an accuracy score. This score is determined by measuring how close the users 
            input is to the rhythm displayed and how on beat the input was. If the score is a negative number this means the user is lagging 
            behind the beat, a positive number would indicate that the user was rushing.
        </p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            This project will require the use of mobile devices, or ways to emulate those devices, in order to test the application.
            The app can be developed on an Android device using a program like Android Studio. Development for the Apple App Store 
            will the require the use of an apple device. I will need to create a developers account on each platform.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>
            To program these apps I would need knowledge of Java (for Android) and Swift(for IOS). I will also have to learn XAML to
            create the apps UI. I may also need to learn the ins and outs of each OS to, for example, properly store user data (e.g accuracy stats) 
            created by using the application. 
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            Hopefully the user will be able to use this app to faciltate their learning and allow them to be able to communicate with their fellow musicians.
